2016 was a productive year - I played in a band as a drummer, swam across the Alcatraz, and went to my first Burning Man.

 Many engineers went to Burning Man at Airbnb (we could see the number of commits drop significantly that weeek) in 2014 and they would often talk about it at the lunch table. It sounded like a festival where people get roudy and party hard to loud music.

and random emails looking for tickets at Airbnb in 2014. At the time, I was not really into music or festivals.  I could not relate to anyone who calls themselves burners. But so many of my colleagues disappeared for that one week. It piqued my interest.

A couple of years later, when my friend Rahul asked me if I wanted to go, I signed up. I managed to get my tickets and started learning everything I could about it, starting with the [ten principles](https://burningman.org/about/10-principles/). They say it is a social experiment in which the attendees build a city in the middle of the desert and bring art, music or anything you can imagine. There is no money; everything is free except ice and coffee.

The next step was to find a camp. The camp is a smaller community in Burning Man where you stay under the shade, prepare meals together, and provide experiences according to the camp's theme. Camp's luxuriousness and size vary significantly from the same basic setup you would see on campgrounds with no shower to those with an air-conditioned lounge and giant art car that is [the body of a 747 jet](https://mashable.com/article/747-burning-man).

We wanted to find a camp that is friendly to first-timers and with basic infrastructures such as a kitchen, shower, and shade structures.

At Burning Man, they call the attendees "participants," and no one is getting paid to serve others. Instead, everybody co-creates, and we become providers and consumers of the experience at the same time. When we decided to join Entheos, I wanted to contribute to the camp before the event to follow the spirit of participation. So I went to Hayward to meet with the camp leads, James, Jose, and Big Sexy, and help with whatever I could. I was amazed that this was just their second Burning Man, and now they are organizing a large camp. I helped them build the stages on top of a pickup truck and cleaned up the tarps for the shades and common areas. My first encounter with the alkaline dust from the desert was pretty nasty.

Getting to the festival was a big ordeal. I rented a car from SFO, and the car counter explicitly said: "no rental for Burning Man,." So I lied that I was driving down to San Diego. The desert, or "playa," as the burners would call it, is located in Nevada, and it took us almost a day and a half to get the line through the desert to get to the city. The party just about started there. People got off the car, shared beers, hugged, and shouted, "welcome home!". Home? Yes, to many burners, the playa meant home.

It was already dark when we finally got to the end of the line after being stuck in the slow-moving line for hours. Finally, when we reached the entrance, a guy greeted us and invited us to get off the car. We got off

I never thought about the city's scale before I saw it.

Meanwhile, I was having my first encounter with the dust in the car. You hear a lot about how the weather can go wrong in Burning Man. Too hot, too cold, dust storm and rains. But for me, the most unpleasant sensation was the first contact with the alkaline dust.

Logistic, Big Sexy, and Jose. I liked them just putting things together and making stuff work. Drying the whole pad of dirty water on a sunny day and scrapping off is not an easy task.

버닝맨은 사막에서 1주일동안 벌어지는 축제다. 그렇지만 단순히 놀고 즐기기만을 위한 곳이 아니라, my friend, Cody saying "Burning is a place that "you check how much you grew a year". 두 차례의 버닝맨을 통해서 나는 어떤 사람으로 성장하였는가.

My favorite moment from bm 2016 was when my friend Steve's bike broke and we had to walk so long across the whole playa. Right in the middle of nowhere we saw a light coming towards us. We walked to it and saw a girl and his dad cooking pancakes. It happened but nobody would find it after that way.

On Friday night I forgot I never entered to giant man sculpture.

Even the memory of sleeping on

I once heard, my friend, Cody saying "Burning is a place that "you check how much you grew a year".

I could not imagine the scale of it until I got there. It is a week that people bring what they love and show the cool stuff to other people. There are an infinite number of these in the playa, some you will experience others you will hear from your campmates, friends. Just like something that never happened, that cool stuff might not happen again ever.

* Burning Man demographic, the Burners, tends to shift towards people with a lot of disposable income.
* The preparation that goes to promotes consumerist and materialist behavior. Gifting culture.
* ubiquity of kindness and thoughtful attentive interaction that happens at BM always sticks around with me for months as a reminder that I do not have to treat people in my default way and can try to approach every encounter with openness and love

Burning Man is an annual gathering in the Black Rock Desert. A temporary city is built and disappears in a week.

One of the value that stuck with me the most after my first burn was the sense of

And let myself loose.

Just a friendly reminder that Burning Man is hot, dusty, the music is loud and terrible, the shenanigans are tired cliches, and the art is unoriginal. This year there will be more tourists, RVs, cops, Instagram models, social media influencers, and general vanity, than ever before. Beware Friday and Saturday, when the weekend warriors show up, and the city turns into a giant frat party. You'll spend three hours at sunrise Thursday morning trying to find the goddam Dusty Rhino for Tycho's sunrise set, only to either miss it completely, or find it so crowded that you can barely hear the music and you'll wonder where all these people came from. Your bike might get stolen on the playa, and you'll spend the rest of the week walking around on foot. Be prepared to wait 12 hours in the gate line just to get into the city in the first place. Ooh, maybe it will even rain and they'll close the gate for a whole day again! Have fun being stuck behind a tractor-trailer on 447 crawling at 15mph the whole

You'll spend three hours at sunrise Thursday morning trying to find the goddam Dusty Rhino for Tycho's sunrise set, only to either miss it completely, or find it so crowded that you can barely hear the music and you'll wonder where all these people came from.

Your bike might get stolen on the playa, and you'll spend the rest of the week walking around on foot. Be prepared to wait 12 hours in the gate line just to get into the city in the first place. Ooh, maybe it will even rain and they'll close the gate for a whole day again! Have fun being stuck behind a tractor-trailer on 447 crawling at 15mph the whole way from Reno, and of course, dodging the garbage bags that fell off the top of a hippie bus on the way back. Better make sure your spare tire is inflated and your jack kit works.

You've spent countless hours shopping on Amazon, reading through packing lists, making sure you have all the right things. Spoiler alert: You won't have all the right things. You'll stay up all night packing the night before you leave, trying to decide whether to bring the black coat or the brown one. And get ready to start scrubbing everything with vinegar when you return, and to finally unpack your very last items 8 months after the burn.

But right now, your expectations are too high. Your costumes aren't good enough. Your schtick isn't on point. Your glitter won't sparkle. Your drugs won't work. You'll watch the temple burn and wonder what you're supposed to be feeling and what the meaning of it all is. Why did you even come out here, to be surrounded by 80,000 wannabe-hippies and try-too-hards? Who cares about a bunch of techies one-upping each other in a Mad Max and Blade Runner cosplay? Is there even any authenticity left anywhere at all?

You'll wander around the outskirts of the city, past the generators and identical shiftpod barracks of the art car support camps, trying to find some semblance of normal. You got in a fight with your partner, and they stormed off in anger. You can't find your friends. You're cold and tired and hungry. When was the last time you ate a real meal? When was the last time you slept? Fuck this place, you think to yourself. Fuck the noise, the heat, the cold, the people, the man, the temple, the org. Fuck the playa. Fuck your burn.
