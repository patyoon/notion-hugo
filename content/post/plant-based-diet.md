Growing up, I always had meat as part of my diet. I only had plants in my meal when I had cold soba or bibimbap when I visited Buddist temples. However, the notion that I always needed meat in my diet changed when I went on a meditation retreat a few years ago when I had the food from the recipes from Zen monasteries. Contrary to my expectation that monks' food must be bland and tasteless, the food was nourishing yet very savory. And adding Goma-Shio (sesame and salt in Japanese) intensified every food flavor. I was so impressed by the food I had at the Zen center I bought their cookbook and cooked vegetarian meals from the book occasionally.

Still, meat and dairy were the core of my diet. I believe that eating animal protein is necessary to gain lean muscle from the workout and intake of essential proteins and amino acids. But, at the same time, I was aware of the effect of meat animals and dairy cows on climate change, so rather than cutting all meat from my diet, I decided to switch to including more fish and cut as much red meat. A few weeks ago, my friend Paul mentioned the documentary "the [Game Changer](https://gamechangersmovie.com/)" on Netflix, and I watched it during my two weeks quarantine in Seoul. Unlike other documentaries that focus on meat and dairy consumption's effect on animal well-being and accelerating climate change, this show concentrates entirely on how we little heard about the vegan athletes who perform at the highest level. I was shocked to learn that I can completely replace the meat protein with plant protein and still consume more than enough protein, plus the added benefit of having a faster recovery time after the workout with the decrease of inflammatory substances in the bloodstream. I have long suffered from chronic inflammation and flexibility issues in my joints with Multiple Hereditary Exostosis. If a plant-based diet could be a lot better in recovery and increase the blood flow in the muscle, I thought this is worth giving a try. I remember feeling much more energetic, mentally focused, and less physically stiff when I was on a vegetarian diet during my ten-day silent meditation retreat. I plan to go as meat-free as possible as I prepare for my first triathlon in late September to see if diet change will result in more energy and less time to recover from the workout. Going entirely meat-free would be nearly impossible living and sharing meals with my family in Korea. Still, I will first cut as much cheese and dairy, so I am temporarily saying goodbye to milk in my coffee and ice cream.
