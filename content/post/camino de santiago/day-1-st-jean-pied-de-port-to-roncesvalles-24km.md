I could not easily fall asleep with excitement and partly because of the snores in the rooms. Pilgrimâ€™s office warned me about the heatwave, so most of the people in the room had already left when I woke up at 6. I got a cup of coffee, and started walking. The trail was already full of people.

I met my Camino buddies in the first two hours of the most challenging section of the entire French Way. Peyman from Malmo, Sweden, Holly from Brighton, UK, and Anne from Nurnberg, Germany.

We met just after a few hours starting the walk but could already feel a strong bond conquering the mountain and savoring the breathtaking views.

The day was mostly uphill, with hikers, aminals, and bicycles sharing the path.

When we reached the top of Pyrennes and crossed the border to Spain, the blazing sun was directly above us, and there was no shade to hide.

After a steep walk down to Roncesvalles, it was so hot, and I broke my record of chugging a can of diet coke.

I could barely climb to the bunk bed and stopped moving for an hour. After dinner at Albergue, I attended a mass. I could not understand anything, but I could feel the energy and spirit in the cathedral.
