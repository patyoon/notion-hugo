Before I had a morning routine, I did not have a consistent way of starting my day, partly because of my irregular sleep schedule, but also, with no plans, I would be just scrolling through my phone or getting right onto the thing that I worked on the night before. I wanted to bring more consistency to my day, and I came up with these four.

**Make my bed**

The first step is to get out of my bed and make my bed. [Tim Ferries described](https://tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/5-morning-rituals-that-help-me-win-the-day-july2018.pdf) in his morning ritual that it gives you the day's first win. And it feels nice to see the bed made, especially working from home all day.

**Put sunscreen on**

The next step is to put on a jacket (multiple jackets these days. After living in the chilly Bay area for almost nine years, the cold is still never something I fully associate with the weather here). Then, I wash my face and put the sunscreen on because the long-term benefit of sunscreen has been proved by scientists, and [everybody is free to wear it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTJ7AzBIJoI&ab_channel=steffyweffy777).

**A slow walk around the park**

I walk around San Pablo Park slowly, like practicing kinhin(經行) - walking meditation. The park is mostly empty, but I see some people walking their dogs, running, or hanging out in front of their houses. I learned that it is surprisingly easy to say hello and talk to people as they pass. People respond when I say "good morning" with a smile, and sometimes we start chatting. I met many neighbors, including my mailman and a jazz musician faculty at Berkeley Conservatory of Jazz. It feels unique to say hello to the mailman by his name whenever I see him coming by.

**Massage**

I use foam rollers and a lacrosse ball to massage my body, try a couple of pull-ups, and hang on a pull-up bar. Right after the workout, I learned that the morning is the best time to stretch after my muscle gets tight during sleep. Neck, hip flexors, and hip muscles are the ones I spend the most time on and are the most painful.

**~~Coffee~~**

For years I relied on coffee to wake up, but the awakeness did not feel mentally clear. I stopped drinking coffee every day last November. I occasionally drink if I need to power through the day or just enjoy the taste of a latte, but it is now replaced with this morning routine.

After these four rituals, I feel energized, awake, and ready to start my day. Once I become more consistent with checking off all four of these morning routines, I would like to create one for finishing off my day.
