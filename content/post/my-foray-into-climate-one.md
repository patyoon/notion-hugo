Why build solar farm on top of parking lots and buildings?

It can cost anywhere from two to five times as much as on open space. Payback time of 10 or 12 years. But still can provide greater than 4% return on PPA aggrement.
Fossil fuel lobbyist have been discouraging government policies that would encourage rooftop solar and parking lot solar.

Use for excess energy.
