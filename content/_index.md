Hello! I'm a software engineer based in Berkeley, right next to San Francisco, CA.

If I were to describe myself succinctly, I'd say I'm someone who actively pursues what I want. But beyond the pursuits, I have had a deep-seated passion for storytelling. This space is dedicated to the moments that made me feel most alive, the times I've faced and faltered against life's curveballs, and the convictions I've formed along the way - ideas I hold strongly but with the flexibility to adapt as I learn and grow.

If my stories resonate or spark a thought, I'd be thrilled to hear from you. You can reach me by <a href="https://bit.ly/email-patyoon" onclick="popup=window.open('https://bit.ly/email-patyoon','mailhidepopup','width=580,height=635'); return false;">email</a> or through [social media](/contact). I'm always open to engaging conversations and new perspectives.
